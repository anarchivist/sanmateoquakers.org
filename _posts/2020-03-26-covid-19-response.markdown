The San Mateo Quaker Worship Group is meeting virtually via Zoom video-&#8203;conference every week on Sunday at 10 AM PDT until the [shelter in place order for San Mateo County](https://www.smchealth.org/coronavirus) ends and our meeting place reopens. Our usual meeting place, Gardeners' Hall at the San Mateo Japanese-American Community Center, closed indefinitely on 3/15.
