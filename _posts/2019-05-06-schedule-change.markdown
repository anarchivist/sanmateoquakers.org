The San Mateo Worship Group will be changing its schedule from 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month to 1st and 3rd Sundays beginning June 2, 2019. We will have two meetings in May, 5/12 and 5/26. This decision was made based upon discussion and reflection with the members of the Worship Group and the Palo Alto Friends Meeting. We look forward to having you join us in the future!
