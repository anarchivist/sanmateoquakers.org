Held under the care of the [Palo Alto Friends Meeting](http://www.pafm.org), the San Mateo Worship Group holds meeting for worship following the Quaker  unprogrammed tradition. We gather in silence, waiting expectantly for the leading of the Spirit, creating a space within and among ourselves for reflection and revelation.

We welcome all who are interested in joining us for worship, whether you have been a member for years or it is your first time; whether you are a senior or a toddler. If you are curious to find out what Quakers are all about, we invite you to attend our Meeting for Worship, and you might find these short videos to be a helpful introduction.
