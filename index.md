Held under the care of the [Palo Alto Friends Meeting](http://www.pafm.org), the San Mateo Worship Group holds meeting for worship following the Quaker  unprogrammed tradition. We gather in silence, waiting expectantly for the leading of the Spirit, creating a space within and among ourselves for reflection and revelation.

## Schedule

The San Mateo Worship Group meets every 2nd and 4th First Day (Sunday) at 10:00 AM at the **Gardeners' Association Hall** of the San Mateo Japanese-American Community Center, at [503 East 5th Avenue, San Mateo, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/dUF4DYRoydx).

Light refreshments will be available after each meeting for worship. We welcome all seekers, including those new to Quaker worship, to join us.
