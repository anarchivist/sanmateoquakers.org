Held under the care of the [Palo Alto Friends Meeting](http://www.pafm.org), the San Mateo Worship Group holds meeting for worship following the Quaker  unprogrammed tradition. We gather in silence, waiting expectantly for the leading of the Spirit, creating a space within and among ourselves for reflection and revelation.

## Schedule

The San Mateo Worship Group will be holding its next meeting for worship at 10:00 AM outside in **Bay Tree Park**, at [150 Dartmouth Road at W. 5th Avenue, San Mateo, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/NG8odiNWH8v) on September 9, 2018. Meet at the two facing benches in the center of the park. Attenders may wish to bring folding or other portable chairs to supplement the available seating.

Beginning on September 23, 2018, the worship group will meet every 2nd and 4th First Day (Sunday) at 10:00 AM at the **Gardeners' Association Hall** of the San Mateo Japanese-American Community Center, at [503 East 5th Avenue, San Mateo, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/dUF4DYRoydx).

Light refreshments will be available after each meeting for worship. We welcome all seekers, including those new to Quaker worship, to join us.
